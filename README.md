A study in live performance of computer music using ChucK

Written in December 2014, this was my first attempt at writing ChucK code designed for live human performance. The piece is launched from initialize.ck and gives the performer four sounds to work with:

1. Clusters of sine oscillators 
2. Clusters of square oscillators 
3. A simple frequency modulation patch composed of two sine oscillators 
4. An impulse generator connected to delay lines 

Each of these four sonorities can be modified in real time using a standard computer keyboard. They may be turned on and off, and the following parameters may be individually adjusted: gain, duration, frequency (Hz). Specific keyboard controls can be found in the comments of initialize.ck

The study would be used as a model when designing the electronic portion of Call, a composition for classical guitar duo and laptop performer.
